# Graph-RAG Anchored Code Engineering, lite variant

## Overview

**GRACE** gives a project **semantic code markup** — region-based contracts and
anchors that make code machine-navigable, documentation inside the code.

Also, GRACE methodology offers Log Driven Development as observable contracts.

## When to Use

- The user asks to **initialize** a project with GRACE markup (activation
  trigger: **"GRACE init"**) - follow the `references/init.md`.
- The user asks to **continue / resume adding GRACE markup** to a project that
  was already started - follow the `references/init.md`.
- The user asks to **review** - follow the `references/review.md`.
- You are working with code with word PURPOSE in comments.

## Markup Reference

### Principles

- Mark up all **public and non-trivial** code.
- Expose public API explicitly via language features: `__all__` in Python,
  `export` in JS/TS, etc.
- Markup must be **proportional** to the code's complexity.
- Python exception: if an entity is annotated by markup, it must always be
  wrapped in a region (unlike C#, where short top-level entities may use `///
  <purpose>` without `#region`).
- For exact comment syntax, refer to the template in
  `_semantic_template_reference.*` files in `assets` directory.

See **Common Pitfalls** for the corresponding anti-patterns.

### Workflow

1. **MODULE_CONTRACT first** — always write the module contract before any code.
  It sets the boundary and purpose of the file.
2. **Public contracts next** — define contracts for all public classes,
  functions, and methods. Create stubs.
3. **Implement** — write code inside the contracted regions.

### Region Types

#### MODULE_CONTRACT

File-level contract. Exactly one per file, placed at the very top before all
code.

Defines **what** the module is for and **how** it relates to the rest of the
system.

**Fields:**

- `PURPOSE` — **required**. The goal of the module: what business/operational
  need it fulfills.
- `SCOPE` — recommended. Functional areas covered by the module and what is
  explicitly excluded (`NOT:`).
- `INVARIANTS` — recommended. Conditions or states that always hold.
- `USECASES` — optional. Scenarios in `[Entity]: [Actor] => [Action] => [Goal]`
  format.
- `DEPENDENCIES` — optional. Non-trivial dependencies: `USES API:`, `READS:`,
  `WRITES:`.
- `RATIONALE` — optional. Q/A format: why it was implemented this way.
- `KEYWORDS` — optional. Comma-separated keywords for grep search.

#### CLASS

Wraps a class definition. Groups related state and behavior into a single named
unit.

**Required field:** `PURPOSE` — what the class enables the user/agent to do.

**Optional fields:** `REQUIRES`, `ENSURES`, `RATIONALE`, `SCOPE`, `INVARIANTS`.

#### COMPONENT

Wraps a React component (JSX/TSX). A UI unit that renders markup and manages its
own state or effects.

Same field semantics as `CLASS`.

#### FUNC

Wraps a non-trivial public function outside a class. A standalone callable unit
with inputs and outputs.

**Required field:** `PURPOSE`.

**Optional fields:** `REQUIRES` (preconditions), `ENSURES` (postconditions),
`RATIONALE`, `SCOPE`, `INVARIANTS`.

#### METHOD

Wraps a non-trivial public method inside a class. A callable unit bound to class
state.

Same field semantics as `FUNC`.

#### BLOCK

Wraps a non-trivial logical block inside a function or method — a loop,
pipeline, or group of related operations. A descriptive one-line summary may
follow the block name.

No fields. Block has only a name and an optional summary.

#### Domain-Specific Types

These types cover common patterns in specific languages. They are **not a closed
set** — add your own types when the domain demands it.

- `LIBRARY` — function group / library (Bash)
- `SECTION` / `SUBSECTION` — document sections (Markdown)
- `VARIABLE`, `RESOURCE`, `LOCALS`, `OUTPUT` — (Terraform)
- `PLAY`, `VARS`, `TASK`, `HANDLER` — (Ansible)

All domain-specific types require a `PURPOSE` field.

### Comment Syntax

Exact syntax is in the templates at `_semantic_template_reference.*` (see `assets`).
Summary:

- **Python, Bash, Terraform, Ansible YAML**: `# region TYPE_name`,
  `# endregion TYPE_name`
- **JS, TS, JSX, TSX**: `// #region TYPE_name` / `// #endregion TYPE_name`;
  `MODULE_CONTRACT` — in a JSDoc block: `/** #region moduleContract ... **/`,
  other fields are JSDoc tags like `@purpose`.
- **C#**: `#region TYPE_name` / `#endregion TYPE_name`; `MODULE_CONTRACT` — via
  `/// <contract>...</contract>`; short top-level entities may use
  `/// <purpose>` without `#region`, other fields are XML-tags.
- **Markdown**: `<!-- #region TYPE_name -->` / `<!-- #endregion TYPE_name -->`

### Region Naming

- Type prefix is always UPPERCASE: `CLASS_`, `FUNC_`, `BLOCK_`, `METHOD_`,
  `SECTION_`, etc.
- After the prefix, use the name in the language's native style:
  - Python: `snake_case` (`FUNC_example_function`, `METHOD_calculate_total`)
  - JS/TS/JSX/TSX: `camelCase` (`FUNC_exampleFunction`, `METHOD_calculateTotal`)
  - C#: `PascalCase` (`CLASS_ExampleController`, `METHOD_ExampleMethodAsync`)
  - Bash, Terraform, Ansible: `snake_case`
- For `CLASS`, `METHOD`, `FUNC` — use the literal class/method/function name.
- For `BLOCK` — any descriptive name (`BLOCK_calculate_regression`,
  `BLOCK_handlers`).

### Log-Driven Development

Use debug-level logging with structured data throughout the code. Every log
message should be a short, obvious statement of intent, paired with key-value
data:

```python
logger.debug("Pre calculation", extra={"event": "start", "param1":
param1})
logger.debug("Business result", extra={"result": result})
```

```javascript
console.debug("Pre calculation", { event: "start", param1 });
console.debug("Business result", { result });
```

These logs serve as **observable contracts** — they make internal behavior
testable and debuggable without changing production logic. Structured data
enables filtering, assertion, and tracing. This is especially critical in async
applications where stack traces are insufficient.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing `PURPOSE` with a description.** `PURPOSE` is the most important
  field: it answers **why**, not **what**. A description says "this module
  handles user authentication"; a purpose says "this module ensures only
  verified users access protected resources." If you strip away the purpose,
  the code loses its reason to exist.
- **Annotating trivial code.** Don't wrap private one-liners, getters/setters,
  or obvious operations. Markup must be proportional to complexity.
- **Inventing business intent.** When `PURPOSE`, `INVARIANTS`, or `SCOPE`
  cannot be inferred confidently from the code, stop and ask the user. Never
  fabricate business intent.
- **Including empty contract fields.** If there's nothing meaningful to say,
  omit the field. Don't fill the template for completeness.
- **Skipping or misplacing `MODULE_CONTRACT`.** Exactly one per file, at the
  very top, before any code. Write it first.
- **Unpaired or misnamed region/endregion markers.** Every opening marker
  needs a matching closing marker with the same name.
- **Duplicate or HOW-style block names.** Block names must be unique within
  the file and describe WHAT, not HOW.
- **Hiding the public API.** Expose it explicitly via language features
  (`__all__`, `export`, ...), not just by convention.

## Verification Checklist

For each file:

- [ ] `MODULE_CONTRACT` exists at the top with `PURPOSE` (and other required
  fields for its type)
- [ ] Every public/non-trivial entity has a contract with a meaningful
  `PURPOSE`
- [ ] region/endregion markers are paired and correctly named
- [ ] Block names are unique within the file and describe WHAT, not HOW
- [ ] No empty contract fields; trivial code is left unmarked
- [ ] Public API is exposed explicitly (`__all__`, `export`, ...)
- [ ] Markup depth is proportional to the file's complexity

For each module (cross-file):

- [ ] Names, `PURPOSE` fields, and block labels are anchored enough that intent
  is inferable without guessing
- [ ] Implementation stayed within the approved write scope; invariants hold

For verification artifacts (when present):

- [ ] Test files carry enough markup to stay navigable
- [ ] Required log markers / trace anchors exist and are stable
- [ ] Deterministic assertions are used where exact checks are possible
- [ ] For important modules, both success and failure behavior are covered
- [ ] Executed verification matches the claimed commands and changed files
