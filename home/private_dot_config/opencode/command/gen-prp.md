# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

## IMPORTANT: Initial Response Rule

**When this command is invoked, ALWAYS start by asking the user to
describe their feature. DO NOT jump to clarifying questions until
they have provided an initial description.**

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements
Prompt (PRP) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The
PRP should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer
to understand and implement the feature. Also wrap lines at 78
columns.

## Process

**CRITICAL: Follow this process EXACTLY in sequence. DO NOT SKIP AHEAD!**

1.  **WAIT for Initial Feature Description:**
    - **STOP AND WAIT** for the user to describe the feature they want
    - The user MUST provide at least a brief description FIRST
    - DO NOT ask any questions until the user has provided this initial
      description
    - Simply acknowledge you're ready and ask: "What feature would you
      like to create a PRP for?"

2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
    - **ONLY AFTER** the user has provided their feature description in
      step 1
    - Ask 3-5 FOCUSED clarifying questions based on what's unclear from
      their description
    - DO NOT ask all possible questions - only what's needed based on
      their input
    - Provide options in letter/number lists for easy selection
    - Goal: understand the "what" and "why", not the "how"

3.  **Generate PRP:**
    - Based on the initial description AND the user's answers to
      clarifying questions
    - Generate a PRP using the structure outlined below
    - Ensure it's suitable for a junior developer to understand

4.  **Save PRP:**
    - Save the generated document as `.opencode/prp.md`
    - Confirm with the user that the PRP has been saved

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are
some common areas to explore:

- **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the
  user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this
  feature?"
- **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
- **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user
  should be able to perform with this feature?"
- **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a
  [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know when this feature is
  successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"
- **Scope/Boundaries:** "Are there any specific things this feature
  _should not_ do (non-goals)?"
- **Data Requirements:** "What kind of data does this feature need to
  display or manipulate?"
- **Design/UI:** "Are there any existing design mockups or UI
  guidelines to follow?" or "Can you describe the desired look and
  feel?"
- **Edge Cases:** "Are there any potential edge cases or error
  conditions we should consider?"

## PRP Structure

The generated PRP should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the
    problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this
    feature.
3.  **User Stories:** Detail the user narratives describing feature
    usage and benefits.
4.  **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the
    feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system
    must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these
    requirements.
5.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will
    _not_ include to manage scope.
6.  **Design Considerations (Optional):** Link to mockups, describe
    UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if
    applicable.
7.  **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Mention any known technical
    constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate
    with the existing Auth module").
8.  **Success Metrics:** How will the success of this feature be
    measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support
    tickets related to X").
9.  **Open Questions:** List any remaining questions or areas needing
    further clarification.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRP is a **junior
developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous,
and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to
understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `.opencode/prp.md` in the repository root

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRP
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRP
