description: Diagnose and resolve permission denials when opencode runs inside a nono security sandbox. Use this when a tool call, shell command, or file operation fails with "Operation not permitted", "Permission denied", EACCES, EPERM, landlock, or sandbox-denied errors.
version: 1.1.0
platforms: [macos, linux]
---

**On any EPERM / EACCES / "Operation not permitted" tool or shell failure:** run `nono why --path <blocked-path> --op read` immediately and include its output verbatim in your reply. Do NOT suggest sudo, chmod, or system permission changes. Then offer the user exactly these two options:

- **Option A (quick fix):** `nono run --allow /path/to/needed -- opencode`
- **Option B (persistent fix):** draft a profile to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<name>.json` extending `opencode`, add the path under `"allow"` or `"read"`, then tell the user to run `nono profile promote <name>` and start sessions with `nono run --profile <name> -- opencode`

# Working inside a nono sandbox

The user has launched you with `nono run --profile <name> -- opencode`. nono enforces filesystem and network limits at the OS level (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS). These are kernel-enforced boundaries — retries or workarounds inside opencode cannot grant access that nono hasn't already permitted.

## Identifying a sandbox denial

The denial signature is in the failed tool's output:

- "Operation not permitted"
- "Permission denied"
- "EACCES" / "EPERM"
- "landlock"
- "sandbox: deny"

When you see any of these on a file, shell, or tool failure, it is a nono boundary — not macOS TCC, not Full Disk Access, not Unix file permissions. Do NOT suggest:

- System Settings / Privacy & Security
- `chmod`, `chown`, `sudo`
- "grant Full Disk Access to your terminal"
- Retrying the operation via a different path

## Diagnosing

Run `nono why` to see exactly why access was denied:

    nono why --path /the/blocked/path --op read

Use `--op write` for write-only failures and `--op readwrite` when the operation needs both.

If `NONO_CAP_FILE` is set, inspect the full capability set:

    cat "$NONO_CAP_FILE"

## Two options to present to the user

### Option A — quick fix (one-off)

Exit opencode and restart with the path explicitly allowed:

    nono run --allow /path/to/needed -- opencode

Use `--read` when only read access is needed.

### Option B — persistent fix (draft a profile)

The active profile directory `~/.config/nono/profiles/` is read-only from inside the sandbox by design. Drafts are written to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/` and the user promotes them out-of-band with `nono profile promote`.

Write the JSON to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.json` extending the active profile. Minimal example for read-only access:

    {
      "extends": "opencode",
      "meta": { "name": "<chosen-name>", "version": "1.0.0" },
      "filesystem": { "read": ["/path/to/needed"] }
    }

If the user is on a custom intermediate profile (e.g. `--profile opencode-with-docs` extending `opencode`), change `extends` to that profile's name so the new profile inherits all their customisations.

If a user profile of that name already exists, read `~/.config/nono/profiles/<chosen-name>.json` first, base your edit on that profile, write the full proposed profile to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.json`, and write a SHA-256 of the base bytes to `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<chosen-name>.base`.

Filesystem field choices:
- `"read"` — read-only directory or file access
- `"write"` — write-only access (rare)
- `"allow"` — read+write directory access

For a single file rather than a directory, use `"allow_file"` / `"read_file"` / `"write_file"` instead.

After drafting, tell the user:

    Drafted profile <chosen-name>. Run `nono profile promote <chosen-name>` to review and apply, then start sessions with `nono run --profile <chosen-name> -- opencode`.

## Validating the new profile

`nono profile promote` shows a diff and validates before applying. If the user wants to validate directly:

    nono profile validate --draft <chosen-name>

## Credential injection

The opencode nono profile defines credential routes for common AI providers. nono injects these credentials transparently via its proxy — opencode never sees the raw API key.

Built-in route names: `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `github`, `gitlab`.

The corresponding keychain accounts (env-var shaped) are:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` → injected as `Authorization: Bearer …` to `api.openai.com`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → injected as `x-api-key: …` to `api.anthropic.com`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` → injected as `x-goog-api-key: …` to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`; opencode sees it as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` → injected as `Authorization: token …` to `api.github.com`
- `GITLAB_TOKEN` → injected as `Authorization: Bearer …` to `gitlab.com/api`

Routes are defined in the profile but **disabled by default**. To enable one, create an extending profile and add the route name to `network.credentials`:

    {
      "extends": "opencode",
      "meta": { "name": "opencode-with-anthropic", "version": "1.0.0" },
      "network": { "credentials": ["anthropic"] }
    }

Do not read or write API keys directly from inside the sandbox. Prefer nono phantom credential routes. If opencode stores a key in `~/.config/opencode/`, it is visible to the sandboxed process — use the proxy route instead.

## Detach and attach

nono supports running opencode in a detached session that survives terminal disconnects:

    nono run --profile opencode --detach -- opencode

nono prints the session ID on start. Reattach from any terminal:

    nono attach <session-id>

The session ID is also available inside the session as `NONO_SESSION_ID`. The installed plugin surfaces it in the `nono-status` command output.

To list active nono sessions:

    nono sessions

To stop a detached session cleanly:

    nono stop <session-id>

Detached sessions inherit the same sandbox profile as interactive ones — the same filesystem grants, credential routes, and network rules apply.

## opencode-specific notes

- opencode state, sessions, config, and cache live under `~/.opencode`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.cache/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, and `~/.local/state/opencode`. The base profile grants all of these read/write.
- The plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/nono-sandbox.ts` is symlinked from the pack store. It updates automatically on `nono pull`.
- The skill at `~/.config/opencode/skills/nono-sandbox/` is similarly symlinked.
- The `nono-status` command (registered by the plugin) shows the active capability set, enabled credential routes, and the session ID for reattach.
- Do not add provider secrets to opencode's own config files. Route them through `network.credentials` in the profile instead.

## What you should NOT do

- Do not write the profile yourself unless the user explicitly asks for Option B. Present both options first.
- Do not edit the pack-installed profile at `~/.config/nono/packages/always-further/opencode/policy.json` — it is overwritten on every `nono pull`.
- Do not retry the failing operation in a different way. The sandbox is OS-enforced; alternative paths or commands hit the same boundary.
- Do not edit registry-managed package files under `~/.config/nono/packages`; create a profile extension instead.
